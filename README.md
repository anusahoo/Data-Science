Description: An education company sells online courses to industry professionals. The company
markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the
website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these
people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Now,
although the company gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.
Objective:
• Select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
• Build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers
with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score
have a lower conversion chance
